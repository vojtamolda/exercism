The classical introductory exercise.
Just say "Hello, World!".

["Hello, World!"][hello-world] is the traditional first program for beginning programming in a new language or environment.

The objectives are simple:

- Modify the provided code so that it produces the string "Hello, World!".
- Run the test suite and make sure that it succeeds.
- Submit your solution and check it at the website.

If everything goes well, you will be ready to fetch your first real exercise.
